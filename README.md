Combinr
=======

Simple PHP script that is run from your terminal.

Allows you to combine multiple javascript or css files in one file.

Simple example of how Combinr works
===================================

You have page that needs many javascript functions but certain function only relate to certain parts of that page
so yout decide to make seperate files for each part so that maintanance is easier for other developers later on, this 
is where Combinr comes in, it will allow you work on multiple files, when you run the Combinr script it will ask 
for the type of file as well as the directory that your files are in and it will combine the contents of those files
into one file that your web app will use, this will reduce the number of requests it will have to make when loading
multiple files and letting you keep your seperate files so it is easier to develop.

Hope you like this basic project of mine.

If you have any suggestions please send me a message.
